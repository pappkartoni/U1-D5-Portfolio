                    I am an aspiring web developer with a background in mathematics. I value clear and concise design goals in software development and want to bring that to the future of the web. 
                    If you want to see what I am working on, you can find my current projects here:

                            Hello! My name is Florian but eveyone usually just calls me Flo. I am born and raised in Hamburg, Germany and that's where I still choose to live today. From an early age on I have always been fascinated by everything technical and I always had the desire to understand how those things work. Turns out it's mostly numbers and I had a knack for those!
                            That's why I went on to study mathematics. I got my Bachelor's degree in 2015 and decided I want to work in software development of some kind. With tons of programming languages and fields of work to choose from I eventually landed on web development. 
                            I just wanted to leave my mark on the everchanging landscape that is the world wide web.
                        </p>
                        <p>I started with a small startup company and eventually went on to work for a large German publisher. Having seen both ends of the corporate spectrum I came to the conclusion that I want to do my own thing so to speak. Whether that turns out to be freelancing or creating my own web development company remains yet to be seen!  </p>

                        <p>As I have always worked for companies of some kind there are little singular contributions to find on the web for now, if you want to see what I am working on currently you can always check out my Github though!
                            I did however work closely with one of the writers at Gruner + Jahr on an article she wrote about preimplantation genetic diagnosis, feel free to check it out (it is in German though).

                            The different brands within the company usually all have fixed designs for their published online articles but we wanted to make an article that stood out because it was a dear topic to my former colleague.
